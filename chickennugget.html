                        <p>We were never really a fast food family. It was a rare delight to go out for dinner. I even knew that from a young age. When I was four, and we went through a drive thru, my mom would ask what we wanted and every single time my response was simple, “chicken nuggets”. What you do not understand was that this was ALL I ever ordered. ALL I would ask for, for dinner. ALL I ate for a whole year of my life at age four. It was so significant that soon adults, parents, friends, and family all knew me as “chicken nugget”. Even today, my neighbor calls me “Beccachickennugget”.</p>
                        <p>So why do I tell you this story? From a young age, I knew what I wanted. And this still stands. No need to compromise my standards, preferences, or choices just because someone else was doing differently. And because I knew what I wanted, I would do all that was in my ability to get it. My mom would try very hard to get me to eat a vegetable or two, maybe a strawberry…but I did not budge. Sure, this could be categorized as stubbornness, but I like to view it as determination.</p>
                        <p>When I know what I want, I will do all in my power to get it. This part of me has created my drive, work ethic, and determination. When my 6-year-old self wanted to score a goal in soccer, she made that happen. When I wanted to excel in school, I would devote large portions of my time and energy to do so. When I walked into a dance studio for the first time with no previous experience and wanted to be a better dancer, I worked my butt off and did so. The day I set my standards for myself, they have not budged. I have never compromised for something that seemed good for someone else. I stuck to what felt best for me!</p>
                        <p>“Chicken nugget” is more than a nickname to me. Every time I hear it, I am reminded of my determination to do good and be good. That is what keeps me going!</p>
