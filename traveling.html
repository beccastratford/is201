                        <p>When I was 10 years old, I remember holding tight to my mom as we walked through the streets of London. She would whisper little facts into my ear about the city’s architecture and the history behind the art and ancient relics. I tried my best to retain the information as I knew that I would be quizzed about it later for a chance to win a prized English HobNob. My parents believed the best way to explore a foreign culture was to walk its streets. Walking miles on end through London neighborhoods, I learned to be flexible, be more outward thinking and remain curious. Exploration began to excite me as a child. That same excitement carried over to who I am now.</p>
                       <p>I love exploring. Learning about cultures keeps me informed and more empathetic towards others. I am able to understand others on deeper levels that nurture lasting connections. This type of exploration excites me!</p> 
                       <p>There is beauty all around us. My patriarchal blessing mentions my ability to find beauty in everything. To me, this highly resonates with travel. Traveling allows me to continue to find and appreciate all the beauties of the earth. Starting at a young age, I watched my mom point out all the beauties that filled the world around me. And now, I do the same with not only the Earth, but the people that fill it.</p>
                        <p>To me, capturing the beauties of earth is very significant. Putting me behind a camera is like putting a paint brush in an artist's hand. I find capturing other’s walks of life to be an art form and capturing allows us to live our past experiences all over again. Traveling, through a lens, has taught me to be observant. I am more aware of other people and what goes on around me, and love to capture the moments that spark joy!</p>
                        <p>While traveling, I am exposed to so many new ways of life! I walk away developing new traditions, feeling more connected with other cultures, and filled with new insights on life. Through it all, I have created beautiful, lasting memories shared between me and those who I travel with.</p>
                        <p>While exploring the beauties of our Earth with my family, I have learned flexibility, outward thinking, and curiosity. It has expanded my knowlege, appreciation, and acceptance of all that surrounds me! It is the reason I am the way I am today.</p>
                        <p>My favorite place I have been to, you ask: iiiiittaallyyyyyy!</p>
